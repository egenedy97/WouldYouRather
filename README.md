# Project Description

A web app to show and create polls in the form of "Would You Rather?". 
The user has to be logged in to actively participate in the app. After voting in the poll, the user can see the statistics of the poll votes.

A project for Udacity's React Nanodegree with a focus on React and Redux.

## How to start & use project

Please use `npm install` and `npm start` to start the project.


## Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

* Users
* Questions

### Users

| questions | Array | A list of ids of the polling questions this user created|
| answers      | Object         |  The object's keys are the ids of each question this user answered. The value of each key is the answer the user selected. It can be either `'optionOne'` or `'optionTwo'` since each question has two options.
